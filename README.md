# Copy-Move-Forgery-Detection
 Implementing the copy move forgery detection algorithm.
 
 In this project, the method mentioned in the article named [Detection of Copy-Move Forgery in Digital Images](http://www.ws.binghamton.edu/fridrich/Research/copymove.pdf) is implemented.
 
 
Before you run the copyMove.m file, you must update the path of the original image and the mask image to be used on lines 4 and 5.

Images to be used for detection must be 256 * 256 in size.

The previously written function of the matlab programming platform was used for zigzag scanning [zigzag.m](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/15317-zigzag-scan).
